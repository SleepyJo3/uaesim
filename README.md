## Rebranding
1. Replace the brand images in `assets/brand/current/` with your own (keep the same filenames).
2. Update brand text, domain, email, and Telegram references across the HTML meta tags and header/footer content.
3. Update `sitemap.xml` URLs to match the current domain while keeping the same structure.
