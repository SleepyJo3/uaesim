responsive html website

## Rebranding
1. Update brand colors, radii, and shadows in `assets/css/theme.css`.
2. Swap hero, background, and OG images in `assets/img/` (keep filenames for easiest replacement).
3. Adjust site name/domain references in the HTML `<title>`, canonical, and Open Graph meta tags as needed.
